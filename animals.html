        <!-- <h1>Animals in Sri Lanka</h1>
        <p>Sri Lanka is an island country in the Indian Ocean. Despite its small size, Sri Lanka is host to a great diversity of flora and fauna. About 123 mammalian species live in the country including many threatened ones. One species is critically endangered, ten each are endangered and vulnerable, and three species are near threatened. Sri Lanka also has high levels of endemism. 23% of all flowering plants and 16% of the fauna found in this country occur nowhere else in the world.</p>
        <p>Some of the most iconic mammalian fauna of Sri Lanka are the Sri Lankan elephant, the Sri Lankan leopard, the Sri Lankan sloth bear, the toque macaque, the purple-faced langur, the golden palm civet, and the Sri Lankan brown palm civet.</p>
        <p>Sri Lanka also has a rich birdlife with 215 species, including six endemic ones. Some of the notable birds are the Sri Lankan junglefowl, the Sri Lanka blue magpie, the Sri Lanka grey hornbill, the Sri Lanka green pigeon, and the Sri Lanka white-eye.</p>
        <p>If you want to see these amazing animals in their natural habitats, you can visit some of the national parks and wildlife sanctuaries in Sri Lanka. Two of the most popular ones are Yala National Park and Wilpattu National Park. These parks offer safari tours, camping facilities, and educational programs for visitors. You can also learn about the history and culture of Sri Lanka, as these parks have hosted several ancient civilizations and Buddhist pilgrim sites.</p> -->

      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        The challenge in the hands of the Department of Wildlife Conservation from 1960 onwards was to ensure the protection of wildlife resources against the large scale multi-purpose development projects implemented in the country. A string of wildlife protected areas was established in the Mahaweli region, with the objective of providing shelter for the wild animal populations, especially the wild elephants, displaced due to large scale forest clearings under the accelerated Mahaweli Development Project. United States Agency for International Development (USAID) provided financial assistance through a special project titled Mahaweli Environmental Project(MEP), for the establishment and development of these protected areas.
